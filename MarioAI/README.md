# Mario AI
###  A super basic version of super mario environment with AI model
###### 

## Emphasis
Super Mario Land is a platform game created by Nintendo and it tells a story about Mario, a brave plumber who lives in the land of the Mushroom Kingdom and he has the role of saving the princess from the hands of the villain Browser.

In this game, there are stages by levels, and some stages are hard to make it to the goal.  AI can understand the environment and take the action it thinks best to reach the goal.  AI recognizes the obstacles and the mushrooms who are Mario’s enemy in the stage.  Unlike humans, AI doesn’t get emotionally upset and can make rational/right decisions.  Also AI can observe and pay attention to everything in the stage(environment) for right actions.  With AI, every step Mario takes, he gets smarter and gets closer to the goal.
